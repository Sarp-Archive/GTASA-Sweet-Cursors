# Sweet Cursors for GTA:SA
Sweet Cursor pack for GTA:SA. Made with TXD Workshop.
I extracted the pointer file from this package and applied to GTA:SA. 
Original Sweet Cursors package for Linux DE's: [Sweet Cursors](https://www.pling.com/p/1393084/)

### Why i made this?
I use Sweet Cursors pack on Linux and I wanted to apply the pack to GTA:SA. Because why not?

### Download
Basically, go to releases and download it.

### Installation
1) Go to your `models` folder in your GTA:SA installation directory.
2) Replace the current `fronten_pc.txd` file with the downloaded file.
3) Restart the game if it's open.
